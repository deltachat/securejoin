SecureJoin: usable protections against MITM attacks
===================================================

SecureJoin protocols provide a usable model for guaranteeing end-to-end encryption
that provides safety for users against compromised servers and networks.
The protocols are heavily based and derived from respective key parts of
`CounterMitm protocols <https://countermitm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
which were produced by reseachers of NEXTLEAP,
a 2016-2018 EU project on privacy and decentralized messaging.

SecureJoin protocols are implemented, user-tested and continously refined
by the `Delta Chat messenger <https://delta.chat>`_.
Other messenger implementors as well as researchers are welcome
to submit questions, remarks or critique either through Github
or by `contacting Delta Chat teams <https://delta.chat/en/contribute>`_.
