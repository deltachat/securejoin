SecureJoin: Protecting chat messaging against network adversaries
=================================================================

SecureJoin protocols provide a usable model for message end-to-end encryption
which is secure against attackers trying to break authenticity, confidentiality
or integrity of messages as can occur with compromised servers and networks.
They are implemented, user-tested and continuously refined in production-releases
of the cross-platform `Delta Chat messenger <https://delta.chat>`_.
Other messenger implementors as well as researchers are welcome
to submit remarks, questions or critique either
`through github <https://github.com/deltachat/securejoin>`_
or by `contacting Delta Chat teams <https://delta.chat/en/contribute>`_.

Today's SecureJoin protocols are derived from respective key parts of
`CounterMitm protocols <https://countermitm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
which were produced by researchers of the NEXTLEAP EU project (2016-2018)
to explore decentralized messaging and privacy topics.
