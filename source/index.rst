SecureJoin: Protecting chat messaging against network adversaries
=================================================================

SecureJoin protocols provide a usable model for message end-to-end encryption
which is secure against attackers trying to break authenticity, confidentiality
or integrity of messages as can occur with compromised servers and networks.

SecureJoin protocols are derived from respective key parts of
`CounterMitm protocols <https://countermitm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
which were produced by reseachers of the NEXTLEAP EU project (2016-2018)
to explore decentralized messaging and privacy topics.

Today, SecureJoin protocols are implemented, user-tested and continously refined
by the `Delta Chat messenger <https://delta.chat>`_.
Other messenger implementors as well as researchers are welcome
to submit questions, remarks or critique either through Github
or by `contacting Delta Chat teams <https://delta.chat/en/contribute>`_.
